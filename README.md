## How To Play With Multiple People

We suggest utilizing `ngrok` to play online with multiple people. Start the server by running `poetry install` to install the project, and then `poetry run python -m server` to start the server. Then, sign up for a free ngrok account at https://ngrok.io and install the `ngrok` CLI using the site's instructions. Once ngrok is set up, you can use it to make the server available everywhere by running `ngrok tcp 8081` and sharing the forwarding link with friends.
